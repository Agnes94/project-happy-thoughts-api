# Project 19 - Happy Thoughts API @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019-2020

The 19th project of the Technigo bootcamp was to expose endpoints thes users and allow them to POST data to the API and then use that data to save new objects in our Mongo database. This is the backend for a frontend project we created earlier in the bootcamp.
